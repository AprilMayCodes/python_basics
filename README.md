# AprilMayCodes Python Basics

Welcome to the AprilMayCodes Python Basics repository!

## About This Project

This repository contains Python tutorials that I've put together for our Discord community. As someone who is also on a learning journey with Python, I wanted to share my knowledge and create a resource that could help fellow beginners.

### Important Note

I am not a Python expert or a professional developer. These tutorials reflect my current understanding of Python as I learn and grow. While I strive for accuracy, there may be areas where more experienced developers might approach things differently.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

1. To provide accessible Python tutorials for beginners
2. To reinforce my own learning by teaching others
3. To create a collaborative learning environment where we can all grow together

## Contributions and Feedback

I welcome feedback, corrections, and contributions from the community. If you notice any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to get involved!

## Disclaimer

These tutorials are meant for educational purposes and to support our Discord community's learning efforts. They should not be considered as definitive or professional-grade materials. Always refer to official Python documentation and more advanced resources as you progress in your coding journey.

## Connect

Eventually, I'll be making video versions of these tutorials. You can find those on [my youtube](https://youtube.com/@aprilmaycodes).

Happy coding!
